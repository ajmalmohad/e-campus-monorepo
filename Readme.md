# E-Campus - Make a Ton 6.0
Simplified College Administration and Student Hub: Web App Tailored for Automated Placement Application Process.
We create a user-friendly web application to enhance the daily life interactions between college administration, students, and potential employers. Our primary focus is on streamlining the placement application process by automating various tasks currently handled by placement officers, students, and HR representatives of companies, utilizing data from the college's records.

# How it Works ?
We have two types of users - each have it's own frontend. There are companies who can register in our application and publish any job postings. They can include the job title, description, round details, deadline for submission and also create a form with whatever fields they want. They can then send these job postings to the colleges they select. Then there is student platform where students can see the placements as well as notifications from their colleges. We aim to expand this section to be used as a college management platform for the students.
